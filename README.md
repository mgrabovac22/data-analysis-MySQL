# MintClassics Project

## Overview

This repository contains the model and the script for analyzing it. The goal of the project is to analyze the structure of the given data model and identify any potential issues or insights using SQL queries.

## Repository Structure

- **Model**: Contains the reverse-engineered database schema (e.g., ER diagram, entities, relationships).
- **Script**: A script for running SQL queries and performing analysis on the model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Database management system (DBMS)](https://www.mysql.com/), like MySQL or PostgreSQL, is required to run the analysis.
- Make sure you have access to the necessary database files or connection credentials.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mintclassics.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd mintclassics
    ```
3. Set up the database:
    - Import the model into your DBMS.
    - Ensure your script is configured to connect to the correct database.

4. Run the analysis script:
    ```bash
    python analyze_model.py
    ```

## Analysis Process

1. **Model Import**: Import the files into the DBMS to create the necessary database schema.
2. **Reverse Engineering**: Use reverse-engineering techniques to extract the underlying model structure.
3. **SQL Queries**: Perform SQL queries to analyze the model's performance, identify issues, and validate the integrity of the data.

## Results

The analysis should highlight any discrepancies, optimization opportunities, or areas where the model can be improved. The script will output the results of these queries, which can help in making necessary adjustments to the model.
